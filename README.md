## Hi there, I'm Kirendarshini 👋

I’m a cybersecurity student who loves building things and learning by doing.

Right now I’m focused on:
- Understanding Linux system behavior
- Exploring basic security automation
- Practicing Python scripting on real system logs

I’m also planning a project to study attacker behavior using honeypots — I’m documenting the planning and learning phases here on GitHub.

### Skills I’m building
- 🐧 Linux fundamentals
- 🧠 Security concepts and log analysis
- 🐍 Python scripting for automation
- 🔄 Version control with Git
- 💡 Automation tools like Ansible

### Let’s connect!
Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or drop me an email. I’m always happy to learn from others and collaborate on cool projects.
